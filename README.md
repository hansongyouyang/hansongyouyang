# Introduction

I'm a university freshman currently majoring in Computer Science in Singapore. I'm in the process of reorganising my portfolio, which includes projects and code samples that I've worked on.

### My Skills and Interests

I'm passionate about computer science and always looking to improve my skills. I have experience in data analytics, database management, and game development. In my free time, I enjoy tinkering with new technologies and experimenting with different programming languages.

### What You'll Find in My Portfolio

I'm excited to share my work with you and hope that you find it informative and useful. Stay tuned for updates on my portfolio!
