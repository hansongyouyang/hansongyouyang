# Introduction
I'm a university undergrad from Singapore and currently majoring in Computer Science with a specialisation in Computer Graphics. [I'm in the process of reorganising my portfolio,](https://github.com/thehansong) which includes projects and code samples that I've worked on. Check back soon!

## My Skills and Interests
I'm passionate about computer science and always looking to improve my skills. I have experience in data analytics, database management, and game development. In my free time, I enjoy delving into the intricacies of UI/UX design and exploring how human psychology influences the perception of a product's UI/UX. Additionally, I relish the opportunity to experiment with novel technologies and programming languages, channeling my creativity to bring these ideas to life.

## What You'll Find in My Portfolio
I'm excited to share my work with you. Stay tuned for updates on my portfolio!
